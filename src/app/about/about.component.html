                                blockchain based company where my job is to develop a web application.<br>
                                <br>I’ve been a developer since I started my career 2 years ago, and have always taken a
                                deep interest in making websites the best they can be for everyone using them.<br>
                                <br>Now I provide a restful APIs from back-end side and develop websites which focus on

                        <p  class="text-italic text-white">I've always loved technology. From a young
                            age, technology has interested me. Most children play video games of some kind, from tetris
                            to spyro, crash bandicoot to final fantasy, I loved playing with computers, but my interest
                            didn't stop just at entertainment.<br>
                            <br>The more I played, the more I wanted to understand how things worked. If something
                            broke, I would take it apart and figure out what had gone wrong, trying to get it back to
                            normal.<br>
                            <br>I never lost my curiosity, but my interest in technologies changed as I expanded my
                            knowledge from taking apart equipment to building new websites in code. In fact, being curious is better than being smart.<br>
                            <br>Now I focus on people and learning how they interact with websites, making sure they can
                            achieve their goals leaving them satisfied and more likely to return as customers.

                            <br>I focus on building approaches which scale well to help promote growth while being simple enough to understand without extensive documentation. Whatever your team requires, I’ll be able to help out and provide improvements along the way.<br>
                            <br>Here's just a few of the tools I’ve worked with in the past. I’m always open to adding more  as I want to stretch my exposure on the others tools.
